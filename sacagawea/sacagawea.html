            <h2>About</h2> <!--paragraph introducing Sacagawea-->
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacagawea is a Shoshone Indian who is most well known for accompanying Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on their cross-country expedition.</p>
            
            <h2>Early Life</h2> <!--a paragraph about her early life-->
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacagawea was born in 1788 in a Shoshone Indian Tribe. Her father, Smoke Lodge, was the Shoshone Chief. At the young age of twelve, Sacagawea was captured by the Hidatsa Indians, who were enemies of the Shoshones. After her abduction, she was sold to Toussaint Charbonneau, a French-Canadian trapper. He then forced Sacagawea into marriage, making her one of his several wives. They resided in what is now present-day North Dakota.</p>
        
            <h2>Lewis and Clark</h2><!--a paragraph about Lewis and Clark-->
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1804, Lewis and Clark were asked by President Thomas Jefferson to travel across the United States and explore newly acquired lands and find a route to the Pacific Ocean. At the start of their journey, they passed through Sacagawea's hometown. They asked Toussaint Charbonneau and Sacagwea to join them on their journey to act as interpreters. In 1805, Sacagawea became pregnant with her first child, but still stayed on the adventure. She gave birth to her son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, in 1805. The expedition ended in November 1805 when they reached the Pacific. They built a fort in current-day Astoria, Oregon. Overall, Sacagawea was significantly helpful during the journey. She was pivotal to the journey because she helped find edible plants, saved important cargo when their capsized, and , most importantly, acted as a sign of peace between other Shoshone tribes and Lewis and Clark.</p>
            
            <h2>After the Expedition</h2><!--a paragraph about her life afterwards-->
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacagawea, Toussaint, and Jean Baptiste all joined Lewis and Clark on their trip back East, but ended their journey early when they stopped near the Mandan Villages, and ended up living there. Lewis and Clark kept traveling. Toussaint traveled to St. Louis to see Clark, and ended up leaving Jean Baptiste there in Clark's care. Toussaint returned home, and three years later, Sacagawea gave birth to their daughter, Lisette. Just a few months later, Sacagawea died. Clark looked after both Jean Baptiste and Lisette, and ultimately took full custody of them.</p>
